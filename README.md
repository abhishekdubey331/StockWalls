# StockWalls üëÄ Images via Unsplash API üñº

StockWalls is an Android application designed to showcase stunning images sourced from the Unsplash API. The app is built using modern Android libraries and follows the MVVM architecture to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code. It leverages Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations, and a suite of other libraries to enhance functionality and user experience.

- **[Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and JVM, used for making network requests.
- **[OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)**: A robust HTTP client for the JVM and Android, used in conjunction with Retrofit.
- **[Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)**: Manages asynchronous operations and ensures smooth execution of background tasks.
- **[Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle)**: Handles lifecycle-aware components to perform actions in response to lifecycle changes.
- **[Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)**: Simplifies dependency injection, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing testability.
- **[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)**: An observable data holder class that ensures data updates are handled properly across the UI.
- **[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)**: Manages and stores UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner, improving data persistence and handling.
- **[Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil)**: An image loading library that efficiently handles image loading and caching with Kotlin Coroutines.
